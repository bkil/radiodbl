# RadiODBL

We're investigating whether it is possible to create wardriving project that:

* is open source
* has open data - you get a fair share back in exchange for your contribution
* scales via decentralizing both in terms of storage and processing
* supports all kinds of signals that should hopefully serve common public interest
* collects various metadata and fingerprints
* presents advanced statistics
* visualizes on many levels
* offers manual localization improvement
* contributes to OpenStreetMap and its maintenance

Inspiration:

* RadioCells.org (OpenBMap)
* OpenWifi.su (OpenWLANMap, libwlocate)
* OpenCellId.org
* WiGLE.net
