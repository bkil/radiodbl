# Algorithm

## Aging

* For each small granule within a trace (e.g., within 30s, within 50 x 50m), determine the average rate of
  * Observing a network that is present in the database
  * Not observing a network that is present in the database
  * Observing new networks
* TODO: for each granule, for each network, determine the rate of observation (compared to the average observation rate of traces)
